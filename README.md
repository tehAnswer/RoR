Ruby On Rails
===

This is my personal repository about Ruby on Rails, the famous web framework created by [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://github.com/dhh). At the moment, my intention is to read all the books that belongs to 'The Facets of Ruby' series and other _must-reads_.

## Books ##

* ~~[Agile Web Development with Rails 4](http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4)~~.
* [Crafting Rails 4 Applications: Expert Practices for Everyday Rails Development](http://pragprog.com/book/jvrails2/crafting-rails-4-applications).
* [Eloquent Ruby](http://eloquentruby.com)
